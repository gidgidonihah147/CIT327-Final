				Warehouse [CIT 327]</p>

			<p id="d81bcc9f-d333-40c4-8f2d-903fa91f5c74" class="">In order to deliver a manageable corporate data
				warehouse or data mart, there are several methods, tools, and techniques that can be employed. These
				methods are chosen based on the organization&#x27;s unique requirements, such as the type and size of
				data, the business requirements, and the architecture of the system.</p>
			<p id="aada03dd-9296-458f-b2d7-c62e7963bc0b" class="">When deciding between the Inmon and Kimball methods
				for data marts and data warehouses, it is important to consider the project&#x27;s specific
				requirements.</p>
			<p id="a8b7ed11-8da2-45b2-b80f-3b93ffe19361" class="">Inmon&#x27;s approach is better suited for
				organizations that need a single source of truth and a centralized data warehouse. Inmon&#x27;s top-down
				design methodology emphasizes data integration and consistency across the organization.</p>
			<p id="afa36287-7dea-46e2-85b9-69371f53d86a" class="">Kimball&#x27;s approach is more suited for
				organizations that need multiple, smaller data marts with a focus on specific business areas.
				Kimball&#x27;s bottom-up design methodology emphasizes business requirements and the need for quick and
				flexible access to data.</p>
			<p id="202dd650-d43d-4f6f-a1a1-fff11d47223f" class="">Alternatively, organizations can use a hybrid approach
				that combines the strengths of both methods. In this approach, Inmon&#x27;s top-down design methodology
				is used to create a centralized data warehouse, and Kimball&#x27;s bottom-up design methodology is used
				to create smaller, more focused data marts.</p>
			<p id="4019d164-6334-4ec1-afed-e2bfa473c696" class="">Ultimately, the choice between the three methods will
				depend on factors such as the size and complexity of the data, the business requirements, the available
				resources, and the project goals.</p>
			<p id="3465a4af-4c39-4e1d-87a3-23c516c2a74d" class="">More often than not, I would suggest a hybrid approach
				as it is the best of both worlds and will be able to meet all the needs of the company. It also will
				have manageable levels of technical debt as the overall data warehouse will need little maintenance
				thanks to the Inmon method, but the areas that need to be flexible can be where using the Kimball
				method.</p>
			<p id="26efa6a9-e232-419e-aa5e-452b06f18778" class="">Now that we have decided which method to use,
				it&#x27;s time to talk about the data itself. The data in a data warehouse is often referred to as
				&quot;big data&quot;. This term describes the vast amount of structured and unstructured data that
				organizations collect and generate on a daily basis. The data comes from various sources, including
				social media, customer transactions, website interactions, and more. The sheer volume of this data can
				be overwhelming for businesses to process, but the insights it provides can be invaluable.</p>
			<p id="425d9f77-63b2-4798-ae37-94632eefd2ad" class="">Big data is important because it can be analyzed for
				insights that lead to better business decisions and strategic moves. By analyzing large data sets,
				companies can identify patterns and trends that might otherwise go unnoticed. They can also gain a
				deeper understanding of their customers, operations, and market trends. With this knowledge, businesses
				can make better decisions about everything from product development to marketing strategies.</p>
			<p id="9ddb2ce3-46ed-4530-b59b-be8826b4b93a" class="">However, managing big data is also a challenge. Data
				must be stored, managed, and processed in a way that is secure, cost-effective, and efficient.
				Organizations must also be able to quickly access and manipulate data to gain insights in real-time.</p>
			<p id="1f6fc29c-4d0e-4e82-b038-f12bafaa995f" class="">While embedded structures, tables, and documents like
				JSON can be considered big data elements, it is not always necessary to use ETL processes to simplify
				their structures. In some cases, other methods such as data virtualization can be used to simplify their
				structures.</p>
			<p id="cb7eec93-50ed-4e9c-a88b-0c5323d0a083" class="">For example, data virtualization can create a logical
				view of data from multiple sources, simplifying the structures of big data elements. This logical view
				can then be used to create a simplified representation of the data without moving or duplicating it.
				This can reduce the complexity of the data and the time and effort required to process it.</p>
			<p id="cda2743c-cfa0-4325-96e1-74fc03e486e1" class="">Another way to simplify big data structures is to use
				data normalization techniques. This involves breaking down complex data structures into simpler ones by
				identifying and removing redundant data elements. This can reduce the size of the data and make it
				easier to manage and process.</p>
			<p id="5a247d61-cb57-4f9d-8675-a58c544cd9a5" class="">What&#x27;s more, data compression techniques can also
				be used to simplify big data structures. This involves using algorithms to compress the data without
				losing any information. This can reduce the size of the data and make it easier to store and process.
			</p>
			<p id="4a3ef550-b899-4cef-858b-f26496918706" class="">Therefore, while ETL processes are commonly used to
				simplify big data structures, other methods such as data virtualization, data normalization, and data
				compression can also be used to achieve the same goal.</p>
			<p id="8056fd1c-4c67-4c81-82c0-09f1f3fd3f90" class="">The next thing to discuss is how we want to view the
				data that we have stored. This can be done through analytical programming, or tools that do the
				analytics for you such as MicroStrategy, Tableau, or Microsoft Power BI.</p>
			<p id="cdcbd70c-9038-4e8a-8e03-31fd0b82989c" class="">When selecting an analytical tool for a corporation,
				it is important to consider a variety of factors, such as cost, functionality, and technical debt. These
				factors can vary depending on the company&#x27;s size, industry, and goals. It is important to carefully
				evaluate each tool to determine, which one is the best fit for the company.</p>
			<p id="9ce9a1a2-ea37-49c7-8940-2598ac417b99" class="">Although analytic programming can be a powerful tool,
				it can also lead to higher technical debt, which can be costly in the long run. Technical debt can arise
				from a variety of factors, such as inefficient coding practices, outdated software, or lack of
				maintenance. When considering an analytical tool, it is important to evaluate its potential for
				technical debt and weigh it against its capabilities.</p>
			<p id="f5c52c4b-3135-4290-b603-136936d4bb35" class="">Other tools such as MicroStrategy, Tableau, and
				Microsoft Power BI can meet analytical needs effectively at a lower cost. However, it is important to
				note that these tools may not have the same level of customizability or functionality as analytical
				programming. It may be necessary to sacrifice some level of control for cost-effectiveness. What&#x27;s
				more, it is important to consider the company&#x27;s specific needs and goals when evaluating these
				tools. For example, if the company requires real-time data analysis or complex data modeling, a more
				powerful and customizable tool may be needed.</p>
			<p id="f51be147-469f-445a-88db-e8973a7d456b" class="">The last thing we need to consider is where we are
				going to store the data for the company. There are several options to choose from that can help meet the
				needs of the company, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
			<p id="b516ac44-6fe1-4a67-886f-30a12c245ffe" class="">One option is a relational or object-relational
				database management system. This type of system is widely used and has many features that make it a
				popular choice. It can handle a large amount of data and provides a stable, well-structured environment
				for managing data. It also includes features such as data integrity, security, and scalability.</p>
			<p id="6b7b1350-4f06-4240-9eef-a651f5870e4b" class="">Another option is a NoSQL database management system,
				such as Cassandra or MongoDB. This type of system is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured
				data and is often used in big data environments. It offers high performance, high scalability, and high
				availability, making it a popular choice for companies that deal with large amounts of data.</p>
			<p id="7b598da0-71d7-42fe-8a83-5a2c11c105c6" class="">Finally, another option is to use XML raw files and
				database-managed documents. This approach is often used for document management systems and is well
				suited for storing large amounts of unstructured data. It offers great flexibility in terms of data
				structure and is easy to use and maintain. However, it may not be the best choice for companies that
				need to manage structured data or require high levels of security or scalability.</p>
			<p id="61d0a03a-5f74-429c-8dff-16e8860a05b5" class="">Overall, the choice of data storage system depends on
				the specific needs of the company. It is important to carefully evaluate the pros and cons of each
				option before making a decision.</p>
			<p id="0ffc2cc0-9cd0-42e9-87c9-57caf3fef648" class="">There is not a single right answer when deciding which
				method or technology you should use to maximize IT telemetry and minimizes IT technical debt as each
				company’s needs vary greatly. One company might require the flexibility and customizability that comes
				with analytical programming and be perfectly fine with the increased technical debt as it means they
				control exactly how they are viewing their data, whereas another company might not care about
				customizability and only care about viewing the data quickly and reliably and another tool like
				Microsoft Power BI would be the better choice.</p>
